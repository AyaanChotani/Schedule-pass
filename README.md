Final Solution

Schedule pass was Developed using a small trigger device which alert’s you
every single time you have a task. We used a buzzer, esp. 8266 and
connected it through Wi-Fi to give input of all the timings of our scheduled
meetings on google calendar. We used adafruit and ifttt for the software to
interconnect our esp. with google colander. Using a laser cutter, a small box
was made from 3mm MDF wood. Inside the box was a simple circuit including
the esp. and the buzzer.
     This experiment was super successful and had zero false
detections, the buzzer only buzzed when I had a scheduled meeting on the
colander

Challenges Faced

While working I faced many challenges including taking wrong measures for
the 3-d print. I re-worked on the sizing of all components and re-scaled the
whole product. It also took me a while to understand on how to connect
Internet with ESP-8266 but using my mentors help I was able to figure it out.
